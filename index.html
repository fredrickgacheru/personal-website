                <p>Like most IT students, I had no idea what I was doing. You may think its joke, but I did most of my first and second years in campus without 
                    a laptop and learning zero skills. So when forth year came knocking, I realized that I needed to improve my skills big time. So I started teaching myself
                    the basics of web design. Now I can laugh at programming memes and enjoy creating new things. Its just fun.

                <h2>Eating</h2>
                <p>My personal best in chapati eating is 8, and they weren't the small ones you are used to, but home-cooked. One of my nicknames is Shifuh which
                    comes from the name Shifu which in Chinese means master. I got this name from my many Man Vs Food conquests where I dominated the food industry. 
                    Basically, I was the food master, the Shogun of meals, the Beasts of Feats.... I could go on but you get the point right?
